Overview of functionality:
Initially you will want to log in as alicerr@gmail.com ,
password = “password”. From here you can add a show, add
a set to a show, add a user to a show (allows editing
privileges for a basic user), and edit various components
of the site. If you are a user (wert@wert.com, and for some
things arr233@cornell.edu) the database will not allow you to
edit shows you are not affiliated with (arr233@cornell.edu is
an auxiliary employee, and can do many things, but is restricted
from adding shows, sets, and certain types of editing). Wert@wert.com
is a basic dj/host and can only edit shows the account is affiliated with.

It is worth noting that you cannot edit or add a track unless
there is a set scheduled to play then. The one exception is that
if you are updating a previously entered incorrect track you can
edit it without changing the time.

When editing tacks, if the time is changed, the user must delete the old track.
