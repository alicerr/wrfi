CSS notes: several invisible elements have heights for now, so that we can see them. This is a very rough draft.

we need

Listener:
Schedule
All Shows
All Djs

DJ:
User Settings
Select DJ name (next to dj selection drop down)
Current DJ name (use get_session("use_dj_name"))
Add dj name


MANAGER:
delete show
add user to show should be Add To Show
Remove From Show
no Schedule Creation button (Delete it)
View all Users

STREAMING:
add a back button link above streaming. use get_last_url() for the url.
You can also use get_last_title() but you should shorten it to 10 charecters if it's above that and add elipses.



dj_drop_down();
